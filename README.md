# Blossom
A program allowing users to look up the meaning of some of their favorite flowers.  A hash map is used to relate the names of the flowers to their meanings.  Seperate chaining is used to avoid collisions when our hashing function collides the names of two flowers.  The linked list data structure is implemented for each of these separate chains.

## Usage
